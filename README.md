The QAFFLE is the next generation solution to the old and bland QAF. Similar in premise, the QAFFLE allows users to create posts and comment at its most basic level. The frontend will be sleek and sexy. The backend will be snappy and robust. We will be implementing features not offered in the original QAF to enhance the user experience.
