The QAFFLE is the next generation solution to the old and bland QAF. Similar in premise, the QAFFLE allows users to create posts and comment at its most basic level. The frontend will be sleek and sexy. The backend will be snappy and robust. We will be implementing features not offered in the original QAF to enhance the user experience.


#### APIs:
- Quotes API: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gci5k5hHDDvYUzxco68au3ej23Wir-8a-xWYDDlI71s/edit
This API gives us cool and suave quotes to motivate QAF users to be more, make more, and do more. With QAFFLE, we hope to give the people the tools they need to be successful. These quotes will push them to use the tools we give them to the best of their abilities. No keys are necessary for usage.
